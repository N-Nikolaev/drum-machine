# Drum Machine
The following application is a simple 8-bit drum machine built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). 

## Motivation
This project was made for the [Front End Development Libraries Certification on Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

- [x] Trigger audio clips upon clicking or hitting the corresponding keystrokes shown on the "drum pads".

- [x] Display the name of the audio clip when triggered.

- [ ] Change the volume of the drum machine

- [ ] Give the user the option to swap between different themes

- [ ] Show a modal explaining the application when clicking the "help" button

### Features

This project was based on the sample project provided by Free Code Camp as an example output and has a number of additional features to distinguish itself from the provided sample output, these include:

- The design was based off of designs made by [Tom Piggott](https://dribbble.com/tompiggott) and [Nikonov Dmitry](https://dribbble.com/mozdock).
- The application was built from scratch using ReactJS
- Utilizies TypeScript for type checking.
- Parcel was used to bundle all the files to reduce file size
- ~~Has light and dark mode theming~~
- And is mobile responsive
