# Drum Machine

The following application is a simple 8-bit drum machine built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Motivation

This project was made for the [Front End Development Libraries Certification on Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).
